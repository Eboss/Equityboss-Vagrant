  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
     # Don't boot with headless mode
     #vb.gui = true
  
     # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
     vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "2048"]
  end

  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.
